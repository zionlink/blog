## About this Site

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

This site is intended to host some articles I write, mainly focused about Information Security. The purpose is to share knowledge. Since I don't like overcomplicated things (and maybe I am concerned about security), this is a static blog. It runs thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Massively Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/massively). Site source is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/zionlink/blog).
